Description: Five software engineering principles and examples

1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
Ex./ A web developer designs a search engine to promote incorrect information about
    the covid-19 vaccine which misinforms the public about their health and safety.

2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best
    interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
Ex./ A data scientist is writing code that analyzes a client's database. The developer
    alters the data and produces incorrect statistics. This is a violation of this
    policy.

3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related
    modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
Ex./ An engineer at Tesla is writing code for a self-driving car and is implementing
    encryption. The engineer decides to take the easy route and implements faulty
    and out-dated encryption which puts the passangers at risk.
    
4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their
    professional judgment.
Ex./ A junior software developer is told by his boss to steal another company's code
    without permission. The junior dev does as he is told even though he knows what
    he is doing is wrong.

5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and
promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
Ex./ A web developer's API suddenly stops working while in production so the maintainer
    decides to steal another company's API and forward it through his own service. It is
    the maintainer's job to make sure his own web service is always available.
